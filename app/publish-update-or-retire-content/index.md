This guidance will help you:

- create content on GOV.UK 
- update existing GOV.UK content
- withdraw or unpublish outdated GOV.UK content

## Make sure you have the right account

You’ll need a Signon account to create, update or retire GOV.UK content. 

We’ll explain in the guidance whether your Signon account needs:

- access to publishing applications, like Whitehall Publisher
- certain permissions within publishing applications

If you need a Signon account or you need to update an existing one, [raise an account request](LINK).

## If you want to create, update or retire ‘mainstream’ content

This guidance does not cover mainstream content. Mainstream content is:

- for the general public or small businesses
- managed by the content team at the Government Digital Service (GDS)

You can [read more about which content is considered mainstream](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/plan-new-govuk-content/).

Published mainstream content will:

- not have ‘government’, ‘guidance’ or ‘find-licences’ in its URL
- not be part of a specialist finder, like any of the content in [‘Air Accidents Investigation Branch reports’](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)

If you want to add, update or retire mainstream content, [raise a ticket with the content team at GDS](LINK). 

The only exception is if you want to update the results of a postcode lookup tool. You can do this yourself. See the guidance on updating the results of a:

- [‘Find my nearest’ page](LINK) – these show users the local organisations that offer a service, like [‘Find a driving test centre’](https://www.gov.uk/find-driving-test-centre)
- [local transaction page](LINK) – these direct users to their local council’s website to access a service or guidance, like [‘Pay your Council Tax’](https://www.gov.uk/pay-council-tax)

## If you want to create, update or retire non-GOV.UK content

Ask your organisation’s content team if you want to update:

- any external sites managed by your organisation
- any services managed by your organisation (they will have ‘service’ in the URL)

There’s guidance on creating and updating [blog sites](LINK) and [campaign sites](LINK).

There’s also [guidance on requesting an exemption from being on GOV.UK](LINK) if you want to create another type of site.
