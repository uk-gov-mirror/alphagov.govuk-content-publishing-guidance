## When to use this content type

Use the consultation content type for content that will meet the [consultation principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance). That may include:

- consultations (officially ‘documents requiring collective agreement across government’)
- requests for people’s views on a question

Do not use the content type for:

- documents that should be added to an existing consultation (such as supporting or outcome documents)
- informal ‘consultations’ like surveys

## How consultations work

Consultations stay on the same page of GOV.UK, including when they’re closed.

On the closing date, the contact details will automatically disappear. They will be replaced by a message saying ‘We are analysing your feedback’.

You can then add the government’s response to the consultation.

### Add the government response in time

Government responses should be published within 12 weeks of the consultation closing. 

Update the consultation page to explain the delay if it takes longer than that. Give an estimate about when the response will be ready if you can.

Do not add any more information or attachments to the page after the government response has been published.

## Create a draft

{% include 'reusable-content/signon-account-whitehall.md' %}

{% include 'reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md' %}

### If you’re creating a new consultation

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select ‘Consultation’ and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. If the consultation is not in English, tick ‘Create a foreign language only consultation’ and select the language.
5. Add the title and summary.
6. In the body, add a brief account of what you are asking people about and who the consultation is aimed at. Keep it to under 100 words, and do not include the closing date as it’s added automatically.
7. Add an opening and closing date for the consultation. You can also add a specific opening and closing time.
8. If the consultation documents and the ways of responding are not hosted on GOV.UK, tick ‘This consultation is held on another website’ and include the link.
9. Add details about the ‘Ways to respond’. This could be a link to an online form, an email address, a postal address or a downloadable form. If you’re attaching a downloadable form, make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK).
10. Tick the UK nations where the content applies under ‘Excluded nations (required)’. If your content does not apply to a nation, you can optionally provide a link to alternative content for users in that nation.
11. Tick the box to confirm you’ve considered the [consultation principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance).
12. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
13. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

{% include 'reusable-content/style-formatting-extra.md' %}

Once that’s done, you can add the consultation documents as attachments.

Go to the ‘Attachments’ tab. Your attachments can either be file attachments or HTML attachments.

If you’re uploading a file attachment:

- make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK) before you upload it
- do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ – this will let users see a box with information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format, like audio or Braille

If you’re uploading a HTML attachment, read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.

### If you’re updating an open consultation

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the consultation you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary and body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
7. Change the options under ‘Excluded nations (required)’ if needed.
8. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
9. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). If you do, select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’ and add your change notes (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
10. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.
11. Go to the ‘Attachments’ tab if you want to edit any of the consultation documents. You can quickly overwrite previous versions of attachments if you upload new files with the same file names as your old ones.

### If you’re updating a closed consultation before adding the government response

You can update the consultation to:

- explain why the government response is later than expected and say when it will be ready
- add public feedback or other documents to the page before publishing the government response

Do not change the original content or consultation documents. They will move to the bottom of the page under the heading ‘Original consultation’.

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the consultation you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
6. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). If you do, go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’ and add your change notes (you can edit them again later).
7. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.
8. Select the ‘Public feedback’ tab at the top of the page.

If you’re adding information about a delay to the government response, add the publication date and use the ‘Summary’ to explain the reasons for the delay. Select ‘Save’.

If you’re uploading details about public feedback or other documents:

1. Add the publication date and use the ‘Summary’ to summarise the update. For example, you can say how many responses were received and which groups responded, but avoid summarising what their feedback said.
2. Select ‘Save’.
3. Upload the full details of the update as a file or HTML attachment.

If you’re uploading a file attachment:

- make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK) before you upload it
- do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ – this will let users see a box with information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format, like audio or Braille

If you’re uploading a HTML attachment, read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.

### If you’re adding the government response to a closed consultation

Do not change the original content or consultation documents. They will move to the bottom of the page under the heading ‘Original consultation’.

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the consultation you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
6. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again later).
7. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.
8. Select the ‘Final outcome’ tab at the top of the page. Add a publication date and use the ‘Summary’ to describe briefly what form the response takes, but do not describe what the response says.
9. Select ‘Save’.
10. Upload the full government response as a file or HTML attachment.

If you’re uploading a file attachment:

- make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK) before you upload it
- do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ – this will let users see a box with information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format, like audio or Braille

If you’re uploading a HTML attachment, read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.

Do not attach any documents that will be relevant after the consultation is closed, like policy papers or new guidance. Create separate pages for them.
