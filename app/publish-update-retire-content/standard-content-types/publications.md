## When to use this content type

Use publications for publishing attachments like:

- standalone government documents – they are date-stamped and usually not updated once published
- white papers, strategy documents and reports

Do not create a publication for:

- meeting minutes, agendas or other meeting papers – these should be attached directly to a [group page](LINK) or [governance corporate information page](LINK) 
- videos – these should be embedded directly in the content they relate to
- guidance that is not in an attachment – use the [detailed guidance content type](LINK) instead

Publication pages should not include multiple documents, unless they are:

- versions of the same document, such as a PDF and a HTML attachment or an interim report and a final report
- chapters of one document
- forms and guidance about filling in those forms
- policy papers and impact assessments of those policies

Otherwise, publish the documents separately and use a [document collection](LINK) to group them together.

## Choose the right type of publication

There are different types of publications. Make sure you choose the right type, because:

- if your content is in the wrong content type, users will not be able to find it
- the content type can affect how and where the content appears in search and navigation
- it could wrongly go into [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/)

| Content type | What to use it for | What not to use it for| 
|---|---|---|
| Corporate report | Publications about your organisation as a corporate entity. This includes accounts, annual reports, business plans, performance and efficiency reviews and structural reform plans. | Publications about what your organisation does, like strategy documents.

## Create a draft

### If you’re creating a new publication

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select ‘Publication’ and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Select the content type from the dropdown under ‘Publication type (required)’.
5. Add the title and summary. Add a description of the publication to the body.
6. Tick the UK nations where the content applies under ‘Excluded nations (required)’. If your content does not apply to a nation, you can optionally provide a link to alternative content for users in that nation.
7. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
8. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

{% include 'reusable-content/style-formatting-extra.md' %}

After saving the page, you can add attachments and images.

> If you’re publishing transparency data, check if there’s relevant [‘How to publish’ guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-publish-central-government-transparency-data) with template titles, summaries and bodies that you must use.

### If you’re updating an existing publication

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the publication you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
6. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
7. Change the options under ‘Excluded nations (required)’ if needed.
8. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
9. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
10. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the attachments and images.

{% include 'reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md' %}

## Add or edit attachments

The publication itself should be added as an attachment.

Make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK) before you upload it.

Select the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the page. You can add, edit or delete attachments from here, and change the order they appear on the page.

Your attachments can either be:

- file attachments
- HTML attachments
- external attachments, if the publication is not on GOV.UK

You can quickly overwrite previous versions of file attachments if you upload new files with the same file names as your old ones.

When you add attachments:

- use the official title of the publication
- for file attachments, do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ – this will let users see a box with information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format, like audio or Braille

### Fill in more fields if you’re attaching official documents

There are extra fields you need to fill in if your publication is an ‘official document’. These are publications that are ‘laid before’ (presented to) Parliament, like certain annual reports and accounts.

If they’re added correctly, they will show up on the [official documents search tool](https://www.gov.uk/official-documents).

The National Archives explains the [different types of official documents](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/producing-official-publications/parliamentary-papers-guidance/types-parliamentary-paper/), which they call ‘parliamentary papers’.

For any official document uploaded as a PDF, add ‘(print-ready PDF)’ at the end of the title.

If it’s a command paper, fill in these fields:

- ‘ISBN’
- ‘Unique reference’ – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- ‘Command paper number’ – use the number found on the title page of the document (if there’s no number, tick the box labelled ‘Unnumbered’)

If it’s a House of Commons paper, fill in these fields:

- ‘ISBN’
- ‘Unique reference’ – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- ‘House of Commons paper number’ – use the number found on the title page of the document, but do not include ‘HC’ as this will be added automatically
- ‘Parliamentary session’ – if you’re not sure which session it is, you can [check the Parliamentary session calendar on the UK Parliament website](https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/recess-dates/)

If it’s an unnumbered act paper, fill in these fields:

- ‘ISBN’
- ‘Unique reference’ – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- ‘House of Commons paper number’ – leave the field blank and tick the box labelled ‘Unnumbered act paper’
