Licence pages are a special type of content that tell users how to apply for licences. You’ll see the word ‘Licence’ above the page title and it’ll be listed on the [‘Find a licence’ tool](https://www.gov.uk/find-licences).

## Add a new licence page

Before you start, you need to email the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) Services Regulations team. They need to know that you’re creating a new licence so they can keep their information up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> DBT Services Regulations team
> <servicesregulations@businessandtrade.gov.uk>


You should also email the Licensing team as they can help you with the process of creating a new licence.

> [!NOTE]
> Licensing team
> <licensing-authorities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>

Once you’ve done that, you can create the new licence page.

You’ll need to have access to the [‘Licences’ option on Specialist Publisher](https://specialist-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/licences). 

If you do not have access, either:

- ask one of your organisation admins to give you access to Specialist Publisher with the ‘licence transaction editor’ permission
- use the [accounts form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/accounts_permissions_and_training_request/new) to ask for access to Specialist Publisher with the ‘licence transaction editor’ permission, if you’re the only organisation admin

If you have access, select ‘Add a new licence’ and add all the content.

When you’re done, select the ‘Save as draft’ button and then the ‘Publish’ button.

## Update an existing licence page

There are different ways to make edits depending on the type of licence page.

For pages where users select a button to apply on an external website (for example ‘[Food examiner appointment (England, Northern Ireland, Wales)](/find-licences/food-examiner-appointment-england-northern-ireland-wales)’), you can update all of the content yourself in Specialist Publisher.

For pages where users enter their postcode and are directed to their local authority (for example [‘Premises licence (England and Wales)](/find-licences/premises-licence)’):

- you can update the first page, and anywhere else that same text appears on the following pages, in Specialist Publisher
- for any other changes, you’ll need to ask the relevant local authority to make the updates in the licensing tool

For pages where users select the ‘How to apply’ link and apply through the methods specified on the following pages (for example ‘[Register as a number plate supplier](/find-licences/register-as-number-plate-supplier/dvla)’):

- you can update the first page in Specialist Publisher
- someone in your organisation can update the other pages in the licensing tool

### Update pages in Specialist Publisher

You’ll need to have access to the [‘Licences’ option in Specialist Publisher](https://specialist-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/licences). 

If you do not have access, either:

- ask one of your organisation admins to give you access to Specialist Publisher with the ‘licence transaction editor’ permission
- use the [accounts form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/accounts_permissions_and_training_request/new) to ask for access to Specialist Publisher with the ‘licence transaction editor’ permission, if you’re the only organisation admin

If you have access and the page is tagged to your organisation, you can make edits to the content:

1. Select the relevant licence.
2. Select the ‘Edit document’ button.
3. Make the changes.
4. Select the ‘Save as draft’ button. You might want to share the draft with someone else for them to review.
5. When you’re ready for the draft to go live, select the ‘Publish’ button.

### Update pages in the licensing tool

Pages in the [licensing tool](https://licensify-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/) are part of a template. Only some very minor parts of the template can be edited through the licensing tool, like fees and contact details.

If it’s an editable part, you’ll need to either get someone at the local authority or someone in your organisation to make the changes. Take a look at the ‘from’ line under the title to see who’s responsible for the page.

The person making the update will need to have access to the licensing tool with the ‘authority administrator’ permission.

If they have those permissions, they can make edits:

1. Select the ‘Customisation’ tab in the top banner of the licensing tool.
2. Find the relevant licence and select the ‘Customise’ link next to it.
3. Select the ‘Edit’ button next to the licence name.
4. Make the changes.
5. Select ‘Save and edit’ and then ‘Publish’.

You should contact the Licensing team if:

- the person updating the page needs help making the changes
- you want to make changes to the template itself and not just the editable parts
- you want to give someone access to the licensing tool and the appropriate permissions to make the changes
