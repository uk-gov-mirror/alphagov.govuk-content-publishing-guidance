description: Learn when and how to publish a complaints procedure page.

Use the complaints procedure page to explain:

* what people can do if they have a problem with how the organisation has treated them
* how to take an existing complaint further

Do not use it to:

* explain related background or procedures
* describe internal procedures

If you create a complaints procedure page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

{% include 'reusable-content/corporate-info-style-tone.md' %}

## What to include

Explain:

* what type of complaints the organisation will look at
* what type of complaints the organisation will not look at (for example because they’re handled in a different way)
* how to make a complaint - if there are different procedures for different types of complaint, consider creating separate subheadings for each
* how to contact someone about the complaint

Do not duplicate information covered elsewhere. For example, if there’s a procedure for complaints about personal data which is covered on the ‘Personal information charter’ page, do not add it here too. 

You can also choose to include:

* what happens when the organisation receives a complaint
* when people can expect a response
* what to do if someone is not satisfied with how the organisation has handled a complaint 
* your formal service standards document, if you have one
