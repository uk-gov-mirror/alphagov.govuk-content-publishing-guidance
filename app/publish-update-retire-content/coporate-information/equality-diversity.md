description: Learn when and how to publish an equality and diversity page. 
lastUpdated:

Use this page to publish equality information and documentation, as required by law for some public bodies. If you’re unsure about what you’re required to publish, talk to the relevant people in your organisation.

Typically, public bodies publish:

* equality objectives
* reports showing how the organisation is meeting its equality responsibilities

Do not use it for guidance or general information about equality and diversity. 

If you create an equality and diversity page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

{% include "reusable-content/corporate-info-style-tone.md" %}

## What to include

Use this text for the summary:

> [!NOTE]
> As a public body, we publish regular information about what our equality objectives are and how we’re meeting them.

In the body content, avoid vague aspirational statements like ‘we’re committed to’, ‘we’re proud of’, and general statements about how important it is to be inclusive.

Do not provide information directed at staff, such as how to join support networks. Put that on your intranet.

### Equality objectives

Say what you publish and how often you publish it. For example:

> [!NOTE]
> We publish:
>
> * equality objectives (every 4 years)
> * reports showing how we’re meeting our equality responsibilities (once a year)

Then attach or link to the relevant publications.

Publications that are produced specifically to meet equality objectives (usually the objectives publication and annual reports) should be attached to the page. Only attach the latest versions. Older versions should be archived.

If there are other publications you want to mention as part of how the organisation meets its equality objectives (such as a staff survey), add links to them.

### Other optional information

You can also include:

* information about organisations you work with to help you meet your equality objectives (for example, Business in the Community, Stonewall, Business Disability Forum)
* an equality contact, if the organisation has a specific contact for questions or comments about its equality work

Only include equality contact details if they’re different from the organisation’s general contact details.
