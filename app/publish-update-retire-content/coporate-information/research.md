description: Learn when and how to publish a research page. 
lastUpdated:
---

Use the research page to give information about what research you plan to publish and when (if your organisation publishes a lot of research).

Do not use a research page:

* if your organisation does not have a significant research programme
* to provide style guides or information for authors producing research reports on behalf of your organisation (send them this information directly when you commission the report)
* to gather customer feedback (do that at the end of the service)

If you create a research page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

{% include 'reusable-content/corporate-info-style-tone.md' %}

## What to include

Adapt this text for the summary:

> [!NOTE]
> Our research programme aims to help us develop policy that’s informed by evidence, and to help us understand the needs of service users.

In the body, link to where the organisation’s research publications are published on GOV.UK. You can get this link from your organisation page - copy the ‘See all research and statistics’ link under the ‘Documents’ section. You can also add a link to the organisation’s older research publications on the National Archives site.

You should also list the major items of research you’re planning to publish for up to the next 12 months. Use a list format rather than a table. Order it so that the closest to publication is at the top. Once something has been published, remove it from the list.

### Optional information

Briefly explain what the organisation is trying to achieve through its research work in no more than a few sentences. You might want to cover:

* the scope of the organisation’s research work
* criteria for commissioning research
* quality assurance or review procedures
* standards and ethics

If the organisation has a formal research commissioning policy or similar publication, you can attach it to the page.

You can also let people know how to become a supplier of research services to your organisation. Do not list individual opportunities, just let people know where contracts are listed ([Contracts Finder](https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder) for a lot of government organisations).

Do not duplicate substantial amounts of content from your ‘Procurement at [organisation]’ page.
